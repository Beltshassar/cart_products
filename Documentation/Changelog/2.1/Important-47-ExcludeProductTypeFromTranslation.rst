======================================================
Important: #47 - Exclude Product Type from Translation
======================================================

See :issue:`47`

Description
===========

For each product you can select a type such as `simple` or `configurable`.
The product must of course have the same type in all languages.

Therefore, this change will remove the product type in the translations and
take the type of the original language.
